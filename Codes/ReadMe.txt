For Matlab:
	/src includes necessary algorithms for TGCR/NLTGCR.
	/scripts includes files to run experiments including linear equation, minimax and softmax regression.

For Python:
	mnist_nltgcr.py is the file we use for testing NLTGCR for a deep learning application on MNIST.
	test_linear_regression.py and test_nltgcr.py verify the correctness of our implementation.
