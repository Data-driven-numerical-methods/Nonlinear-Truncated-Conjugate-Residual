# Nonlinear-Tructated-GCR
Optimization, Iterative Algorithm, Numerical Analysis

## Matlab:
 To run the code, run 'run_me_first.m' fisrt. 
src folder contains implementations of baselines and nltgcr
 To run an experiment, go to scripts folder

## Python:
 Each folder contains one deep learning application. main.py is for baselines inlcuding SGD, Nesterov, Adam. main_nltgcr.py is for our method.
test_nltgcr_demo.py solves a linear system. The convergence is identical to CG, which verifies the correctness of implementation.
